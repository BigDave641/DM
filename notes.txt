- create annotation link, line 175 of ClientApp.js

- hover menu contents panel in atb.AnnoTitlesList

- show hover menu in atb.viewer.Viewer, line 428
  - each viewer loads their own set of buttons.

- show hover menu in canvas viewer: atb.viewer.CanvasViewer.onFeatureHover, line 143

- create text annotation from canvas viewer: atb.viewer.CanvasViewer.createTextAnno()

- sc.data.DataBroker.createAnno

- has to do with creating annotations in text editor: atb.viewer.Editor.prototype.createNewTextBody

- what causes new triples to be written to the back end?




To save annotations:
- Must keep track of all new annotations created using databroker's createAnno method
- At save interval:
  - create a new graph (empty)
  - create a blank node
  - for each new annotation:
    - add [blank node, ore:aggregates, anno] triple to new graph 
    - get annotation's target and body (if one exists)
    - if target is an oa:SpecificResource
      - get its source and selector
    - if body is an oa:SpecificResource
      - get its source and selector
    - For the 3-7 nodes you've collected (anno, target, body, and source and selector for each of target and body) find all triples that have any one of these as a subject
  - Put all these triples in new graph
- dump graph in post request
